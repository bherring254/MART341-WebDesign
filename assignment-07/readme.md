## Assignment 7

Forms are found everywhere on the web when buying goods as a payment and shipping form is almost always used as well as typically stored for next time (at the user's discretion). More generally it is used to enter data for a server to process.

An example of a text input can be a person's name as seen in this week's homework webpage. A selection input can be a number of pre-determined choices to help the end-user know what's expected. Radio buttons are an example. when a form is filled out. Button inputs can provide graphic interest as well as functionality to your links and fields; the submit form sends a form to a server. There are uploads, submits, image buttons, and the button element.

My work during this cycle consisted of alt+tabbing between W3 Schools, the class website, Atom, and Github. I made use of Preview in Atom in order to assess issues on the fly but I found that it wasn't always the same look as when I accessed the Github site via Chrome. I had some issue with the form at first but I was able to add some styling and establish the fundamentals by practicing on W3 Schools and humbly referencing their most simple forms.
