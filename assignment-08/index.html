          Robert's got a quick hand
          He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
          He's got a rolled cigarette
          Hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
          Yeah found a six shooter gun
          In his dad's closet, oh in a box of fun things
          I don't even know what
          But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          Daddy works a long day
          He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
          And he's bringing me a surprise
          'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
          I've waited for a long time
          Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
          I reason with my cigarette
          And say your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
          All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
          You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
