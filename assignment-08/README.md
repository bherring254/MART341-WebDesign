1.  
    Divs: Offer a block-level element to group other elements together.
    Classes: An identifier and selector value for HTML elements. Groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value.
    ID: Acts as a global identifier.
    Spans: The inline equivalent of the div element. Spans can exist within divs, and do not create full-width blocks; serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling. You can have multiple span elements inside a div.

2. The advantages of hosting a video off-site is that you save on the space needed to allocate for said videos; this can really slow down your website as a disadvantage that follows. Another disadvantage is that there can be slower, less-reliable playback depending on the host. On the other hand, hosting a video on your own site would result in more privacy and control of the media.

3. I have had a huge problem with my Lyrics container and I'm unsure why it's not working. I've tried a lot of combing through the code and reworking stuff but I still am unsure as to why it's slightly off compared to the other containers. I typically use the Atom Preview package but I had to move to the website in order to properly format some of this page. I am updating this page to inform you that I found out I missed a few div tags and have since resolved the issue.
