  ## Assignment 12

1. Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. Margin is the space between the element and other elements. Borders can be created in one lump property (or each side) and property of the outside of that element selected.

2. There was a lot of information on this assignment and I found that I had already done a lot with borders and padding. However, I found that by controlling the margin I was able to make a decent looking float around the raven picture. Floating was difficult to understand and I'm not sure if that was due to the website or just my inability to grasp the concept. I ended up using external sources but was able to figure out what I needed. I'm starting to gather a better understanding why we div-class everything and when one may NOT want to div class something. I further tried to improve on readability of code as it can be difficult to track where issues can be. W3schools is a life saver.
