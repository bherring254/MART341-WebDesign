**Assignment 6

A main body page can have only one <head> and <body> element for each page. The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag; in this sense we can say that it contains the thoughts of the page. The <meta> element lives inside the head element and contains information about that webpage. The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers to display content or reload page, by keywords in search engines, and other web services.

Structural markup are the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. Semantic markup are the elements which provide extra information, such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, etc.

The work cycle for this assignment was rather funny as it consisted of me looking back at my previous few assignments to make sure everything was correct with Atom. Once I had established my new webpage I worked on it through Atom while I kept my index.html open on Chrome so I could see the changes happening real-time. This was the brunt of the work as I modified the format and picture to make it look decent (not good though).
