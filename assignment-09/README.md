## Assignment 9

1. My experience with HTML has been primarily review as I have taken a few courses which lightly covered it. For me, the structure is very akin to coding but the syntax is something I've forgotten. So I spent most of my time alt+tabbing W3 Schools in order to check my syntax. Additionally, there's just so many cool features that I'm totally unaware of that are really powerful! I'm excited now that we're working on HTML/CSS together as my pages are looking significantly better than at the start of the semester.

2. My primary concern is making sure whatever page I create, it is simple, elegant, easy to use, and functional. I would like to practice further with CSS to make animated elements and whatever else functionality I'll be able to take advantage of. My actual concern is to make a webpage that also looks good on mobile, as it's such a popular feature. Moodle is probably the worst app and tends to be unusable on a phone... I don't want to make those mistakes!

3. This previous week's work has been really meaningful for me. I enjoyed the review page that is now bookmarked as it's been a *fantastic* resource. I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could apply these things to the project that Michael sent an email about and want to really focus on polish, simplicity, and functionality. Too many times I am flustered by a page's complexity and am unable to properly maneuver through it because of said complexity.
