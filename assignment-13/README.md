## Assignment 13

1. My imaginary client was a law firm or some form of corporate business. The reason I chose this was because I make a lot of memey and funny sites but I wanted to concentrate on a serious one this time. I based a navbar in black to offset the very mild blue background. I figured this would give a feeling of calm and order, exactly what a client looking for a lawyer would hope for. On the other hand, design-wise the whole site was built from the ground up for mobile. After that I was able to easily use @media functions to make the site look better for tablet/desktop users. Other than that I kept the site very simple.

2. Mobile-first design is important because there are over 3.8 billion phones in use right now. As such, the phone is the largest market to capture. This number will only increase compared to the laptop, tablet, or desktop computer.

3. Out of all the projects, this one was incredibly difficult for more. It harkened back to all the previous assignments, but also required mobile-first design which required A LOT of extra time to research. Nearly twenty work hours later I have been gifted with the confidence of how to build websites that I would've never dreamed. I'm most proud of my contact us page and was able to utilize responsive web design all throughout the site. It was also the first time that I built a site with a "mobile-first" intention. I'm glad it's over because it was a hell of a run.
